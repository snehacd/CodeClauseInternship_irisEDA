## Overview
This EDA aims to explore the Iris dataset, a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics, containing measurements of iris flowers. The analysis provides insights into the distribution of features, relationships between features, and differences across iris species.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. There are three classes of iris plants: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
### Dataset Overview
- Load the dataset and examine its structure.
- Check for missing values, data types, and summary statistics.

### Descriptive Statistics
- Compute summary statistics for numerical features.
- Compute descriptive statistics for each class (species) separately.

### Univariate Analysis
- Visualize the distribution of each feature using histograms.
- Identify outliers, skewness, and patterns in feature distributions.

### Bivariate Analysis
- Explore relationships between pairs of features using scatter plots.
- Compare feature distributions across species using box plots.

### Multivariate Analysis
- Visualize pairwise relationships between features using pair plots.
- Use color to differentiate between species in visualizations.

### Summary and Insights
- Summarize key findings and insights gained from the analysis.
- Discuss patterns, correlations, and trends observed in the data.
